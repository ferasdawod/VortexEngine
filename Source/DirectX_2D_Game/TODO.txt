stuff to do

Vertex Shader :

*- the input struct should have everything needed to work
*- the members should be ordered in the right order with must have stuff at the top and optional stuff to the down
*- this way we can have more than one vertex structure all sharing the same input layout
*- each new vertex structure should define new data members after the old members
*- then we can have more than one techniques each using defined data members

Rendering :
*- suggested shader manegment workflow:
	-	we define constants like:
			#define USE_NORMAL_MAPPING, USE_LIGHTING, USE_SHADOWS, etc...
	-	for each possible combination of defines we compile the shaders and calculate a integer mask based upon these defines:
		example: 1011 : USE_LIGHTING + !USE_SHADOWS + USE_TEXTURING + USE_NORMAL_MAPPING
	-	foreach render request and based on it's material we calculate the same integer value to figure out which shader to user
	-	on rendering we use that integer as an index into the shader map to get the correct shader
	
make the directional lights have a camera of its own
the render manager can have a list of cameras
the user can switch between active cameras
the effect light view projection matrix can then be get from the light camera
make the rendering manager sort the render request
	- one way to do this is by creating a dedicated rendering queue class which sorts render request as they are added
	- another way to do this is by sorting the whole queue after everyone has submitted their render items.

The RAW file format
the file stores only the height value in 8bits ( aka 1 byte)
so we can read the whole file and move one byte at a time to get the height values

General :
*- handling the destruction of the window handle in the editor application (check the web and the d3d samples in the learning/c++)
*- lookup : SetDebugBreak()

Resource Management :
*- the res handle only holds an index to the resource
*- the res handle has a template method for getting the resource
*- when loading a resource the res cashe creates a handle and gives it the resource index
*- the res cashe has a vector of resources ( maybe another container )
*- the res cashe can assign a default resource while it loads the original resource in the background
*- when the loading is complete it simply replace the resource at that index with the right resource
*- that way the res handle stays valid even though the resource has changed but it only had an index to the resource

*- we can make a class whose job is to create default resources for a given type


Culling
*- only cull when doing color render ( no culling during shadow pass )
*- each sub mesh should have a bounding sphere
*- the bounding sphere is calculated when loading the mesh in the mesh loader
*- when rendering the bounding sphere is tested against the camera view frustum and the mesh is only drawn if it's visible
